How Python Works

Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language known for its readability and versatility.

Interpreter: An Interpreter is a program that executes python code line by line
Ex: Cpython, IDLE, PyPy

How Python Works:

            Python.py   ----> Code
               -   
               -     
            Bytecode
              -
              - 
            Execute Each Instruction

Python Interpreter will do 2 jobs

1. Compile ---> Converts .py into bytecode
2. Virtual Machine(PVM) ---> Executes the byte code

"Python is interpreted because python code is executed line by line by the interpreter at runtime instead of being fully compiled into machine code before execution"
